# speedingTicket
These are my final projects from my winter and spring quarters at UCSC.

Descriptions:

"294" is the winter R final, where I clean the publicly available Montgomery County traffic stop data and create the speeding ticket dataset.

"final" is the spring Python final. I do some basic summary statistics and data visualization for the speedinng ticket dataset.
